- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I think it's quite intuitive and basic, since it's something we've been using this whole time, it's just that now we know the name of it and can influence it/override it ourselves. I think it makes things a lot easier and you have a lot more wiggle room to focus on certain details.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It took a lot to figure out hashtables as they aren't the most intuitive. I really struggled with looping through the values, as I felt like hashtables were never covered in class, and none of their methods were either. I would prefer more background information for something like that, because even though I was able to figure it out, it took a lot of stressed out googling that was super unpleasant. The rest was pretty smooth sailing though. 
For the cafe, I chose to restock when the amount of materials needed is less than those available. While I have worked as a barista for about 3 years, this seemed to be the most automatic way to do it coding.
